# Portfolio website for David Lundstr√∂m

I've always had my repos private, but rumor has it recruiters seem to like seeing Git-activity. Who would have thought?

This will hopefully become a portfolio website for me, David, but is also very much a learning project.

## Personal goals for the project

- Learn more about Next.JS
- Learn more about SEO and make the site SEO-friendly. Likely to follow [this course by Fireship](https://fireship.io/courses/react-next-firebase/) to learn more about both Next and SEO.
- Finish [this UX course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-user-experience-design), to learn more about UX and hopefully some UI-design as well.
- Get more comfortable with Framer Motion; move animations from CSS written with Styled Components to using Framer.

## Requirements

- Make sure the site follows WCAG-guidelines
